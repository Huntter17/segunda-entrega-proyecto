                    Peter's life changes forever while he is on a class field trip and is bitten by a genetically-enhanced spider that had escaped from its container.

                <p>Peter Parker (Earth-120703)
                    Peter Parker is a vigilante superhero who was bitten by a genetically-altered spider, thus transforming him into a successful cross-species hybrid known as Spider-Man.
